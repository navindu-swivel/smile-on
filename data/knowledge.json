    "content": "Full Arch Restoration with Dental Implants. Replace your teeth and transform your smile. Do you want to improve your smile? The TEETH ON IMPLANTS® dental implant system is a dental technique that can offer a long-lasting solution to missing teeth. The treatment involves supporting all teeth on multiple implants, making them look, feel and function just like natural teeth. The procedure is particularly suitable for patients who may have missing, decayed or broken/chipped teeth. Available at 30+ Smile On Clinics How Teeth On Implants® can enhance your smile Teeth On Implants® is a complete oral rehabilitation that can give you natural looking teeth and allow you to speak, smile and laugh with renewed confidence. Read More Why Living with Missing Teeth Can Be Challenging and What Can Be Done About It Dental implants have proven to be a revolutionary solution for individuals struggling with missing teeth. Whether you are dealing with a single missing tooth or need to replace multiple teeth, this advanced dental treatment can make it easier for you to eat, speak, and smile with confidence. At Smile On Clinics, we are highly experienced in dental implant procedures that are designed to feel and function just like natural teeth while offering a long-lasting solution to tooth loss. Missing teeth can cause a range of problems that can affect people both physically and emotionally. Beyond the obvious cosmetic concerns, missing teeth can lead to difficulty in eating, speaking, and maintaining proper oral hygiene. The gaps left by missing teeth can become infected, and teeth can shift out of place over time as there is one less root to support them. This can result in more dental issues, such as bite problems, jaw discomfort, and an increased risk of gum disease. Multiple missing teeth can lead to significant changes in the structure of your mouth, making it difficult to chew food properly and affecting your appearance. Full mouth dental implants are a solution that helps restore the structure of your mouth and give you a more youthful and attractive smile. One of the main reasons people avoid addressing missing teeth is the perceived high cost of dental implants. However, when considering the long-term benefits, such as improved oral health, increased self-esteem, and a lasting, natural-looking smile, the investment in dental implants is well worth it. Dental implants provide a solution to tooth loss by replacing both the missing tooth root and the tooth itself. They are placed directly into the jawbone, and as a result, they are a lot more stable than dentures or bridges. This helps to preserve the structure of the surrounding teeth and bone, ensuring that you can maintain optimum oral health and functionality. What to Expect During the Dental Implant Procedure The dental implant procedure involves several steps. Firstly, our skilled team will assess how healthy your gums, jaw, and remaining teeth are so they can develop the best treatment plan for you. In cases where the jawbone isn’t strong enough to support an implant, bone grafting may be recommended to strengthen it beforehand. Once the necessary preparations are complete, the dental implant is placed into the jawbone during a minor surgical procedure. After the implant has been put in, it takes several months for the bone to fully fuse with the implant. Once this process is complete, we will attach a custom crown, bridge, or denture to the implant to restore your smile and aid speech and eating. For patients who are missing a full set of teeth, we offer full mouth dental implants, which can be used to replace both the upper and lower teeth. This comprehensive treatment can transform your entire smile. However, you should be aware that results can differ between patients, and your dentist will be able to let you know if you’re a strong candidate for this cosmetic procedure. Dental implant surgery is typically performed under local anaesthesia to ensure that the procedure is as comfortable and pain-free as possible. The procedure may take a few hours, depending on how complex the process turns out to be. After the surgery, you might experience some swelling or discomfort, but don’t worry, this is normal and can be managed with prescribed medications and proper post-surgical care. Recovery time varies, but most patients can resume normal activities within a few days. It is important to follow all post-operative instructions to give yourself the best chance to heal quickly, reduce complications, and ensure long-term success of your dental implants. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor progress and ensure that your implants are properly integrating with your jawbone. What is Bone Grafting, and Why is it Necessary? Bone grafting is a procedure where bone material is added to the jaw to promote regrowth. This is often necessary when there is insufficient bone to fuse to dental implants. This can occur due to bone loss caused by factors like gum disease, ageing, or tooth loss over a long period of time. Bone grafting can help to improve the overall outcome of implant treatments for some patients. Replacing Missing Teeth with Natural-Looking Results Dental implants are designed to look and function just like natural teeth. The replacement teeth are made to match the original size, shape, and colour of your existing teeth, so they give you a polished and natural appearance, regardless of whether you’re replacing a single missing tooth or a full set. In addition to their natural appearance, dental implants offer a range of benefits compared to other cosmetic treatment options. Unlike dentures, which can come loose or cause discomfort, dental implants are securely attached to the jawbone, providing a stable and comfortable solution. The Importance of Maintaining Healthy Surrounding Teeth When replacing missing teeth with dental implants, it’s important to remember that the success of the procedure can be affected if the health and condition of the surrounding teeth are poor. It may be necessary to address these issues before proceeding with implant surgery. In cases where gum disease is detected, treatment may be required to ensure that the gums and surrounding tissues are healthy enough to support the implants. At Smile On Clinic, we provide comprehensive care to deal with any underlying dental issues, such as gum disease, before we recommend going ahead with any cosmetic procedures. How Much Do Dental Implants Cost? A question we hear most frequently at Smile On Clinic is, “How much do dental implants cost?” While they are often more expensive upfront compared to dentures or bridges, it’s important to look at the long-term value they provide. Dental implants are not just a band-aid to temporarily resolve a problem; they’re designed to be permanent, durable, and low maintenance, making them a smart, cost-effective solution over time. When maintained properly, dental implants can last for decades, and they help preserve jawbone health and the functionality of surrounding teeth, which can reduce the need for extra treatments in the future. Unlike temporary options, they do not shift, wear down adjacent teeth, or need to be frequently replaced. You’ll be able to save money, time, and a world of pain in the future. At Smile On Clinic, we offer transparent pricing, without any hidden costs or surprises. Every smile is different, and so are the treatment needs and costs. During your consultation, we will assess your oral health and provide a detailed breakdown of all associated costs, including: The number of implants needed (single, multiple, or full mouth dental implants) Any preparatory procedures (like tooth extraction or bone grafting) The type of restoration (crowns, bridges, or dentures) Surgical and laboratory fees Post-operative care and follow-up appointments. We believe that high-quality care should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their income, which is why we offer a range of financing options for all budgets. Whether you need one dental implant or a complete smile makeover, our team will guide you through every step with clarity and compassion for your situation. At Smile On Clinic, we understand how challenging living without natural teeth can be. Our experienced team provides personalised dental implant solutions, whether you’re replacing a single tooth, several teeth, or need a full set. We use cutting-edge technology to deliver the highest standard of care. Our modern techniques allow us to implant teeth with precision and stability, giving you results that look and feel completely natural. We’re dedicated to helping you restore your smile and dental functions. Contact us today to schedule a consultation and explore your options for a better quality of life.

Digital Smile Design Digital Smile Design enables patients to visualize the end result prior to having the procedure performed. The process involves digital photography and computer-aided design programs to aid dentists with planning cosmetic and restorative dental treatments more reliably, efficiently, and effectively. Allowing patients and dentists to see the final result of the planned procedure improves accuracy, affords the opportunity for modifications and adjustments before the procedure, and results in greater patient satisfaction with the outcome. Teeth Whitening Teeth whitening is a cosmetic procedure that helps to lighten teeth by removing stains and reducing discolouration. You can whiten your teeth with a take-home kit from over the counter, however, it won’t be as effective as an in-chair treatment. In-chair treatments lead to more effective results without damaging your tooth enamel. In addition, results are visible instantaneously. Invisalign Invisalign is the virtually invisible and hygienic dental treatment that uses a series of custom-made, clear, removable aligners that gradually align the teeth. Unlike traditional braces and retainers, Invisalign works effectively to straighten the teeth without disrupting lifestyle activities. It’s a simple, painless and effective way to transform your smile and ultimately change your life. Dental Veneers Dental veneers are very thin, custom-made shells that are added to the front of a tooth to mask its colour, shape, or positioning in the mouth. Once affixed, veneers appear natural-looking and perfectly complement facial features. Veneers are usually used to replace chipped, cracked, misaligned, or discoloured teeth, or to improve your smile! After braces, this patient was still unhappy with her smile. She finally wanted to get the smile of her dreams before her big day. We trialled several smiles until she was happy with this design. Married with a smile and lived happily ever after! Did you know you can request this exact smile – we can now carbon copy any smile so you can have the smile of your dreams too? Dental Implants The Teeth On Implants® system is a highly effective dental technique that offers a solution to missing teeth. The treatment refers to supporting teeth on multiple implants, making them look, feel and function just like natural teeth.

    "content": "Does the very thought of a dental procedure make you anxious? You are certainly not alone; in fact, a significant percentage of people experience dental fear and anxiety. Our team at Smile On Clinics practices can help you with your dental anxiety and are committed to ensuring your experience is as comfortable and stress free as possible. Sleep Dental Clinics and Sedation can help anxious patients Having dental treatment while you are asleep is known as Sleep Dentistry and may also be referred to as Dental Sedation, Sleep Sedation, Twilight Sedation and Sedation Dentistry involves IV sedation and anaesthesia to induce sleep and reduce pain, awareness and recollection during dental procedures. In this way, it alleviates the fear, anxiety and discomfort that may often be associated with general and paediatric dentistry. Sedation dentistry allows patients to feel at ease and comfortable when undergoing treatment. Some dental patients are apprehensive and anxious when they are having treatment. We understand that this may be a deterrent for many patients. By easily accommodating our patients with sedation, patients can complete their treatment plans with confidence. In-chair professional sedation services For patients wanting to have all treatment performed at the dental practice, we regularly perform surgical procedures in the dental chair using sedation and sleep dentistry techniques. This will make your dental treatment nice and smooth. No procedure is too small for this process. If you are a patient who is too anxious to have a dental clean, then sedation can definitely help you. The most common procedures performed under dental sedation are: Wisdom teeth extractions Tooth extractions Fillings Implants However, any dental procedure can be performed. General anaesthetic at the private hospital Some patients prefer to be completely under for surgical procedures, and we are pleased to be able to offer such an option. We also have highly complex cases where we recommend treatment to be completed under general anaesthetic. General anaesthetic facilities are available at Brisbane, allowing us to deliver quality dental surgery – including full arch rehab (we perform this weekly) and implants almost every day! Patients can then also receive the amazing aftercare that the lovely nurses at Brisbane Waters Private Hospital provide. If you have been putting off dental treatment because you are anxious or worried about pain, don’t be. We have the ideal solution to suit your individual requirements and ensure your experience is as comfortable and pain-free as possible. Are you anxious about dental treatment and would like our team to help you to smile again?

Our friendly and professional team are here to set your mind at ease, incorporating state-of-the-art equipment to help you feel comfortable and cared for. Choosing a Smile On Clinics Burwood dental practice gives you the comforts of a small, local team as well as the benefits of an expanding brand, available across Australia. Our highly experienced team members prioritise the care of our patients, delivering excellence from the moment you walk through the door. What Dental Services Are Available to Burwood Residents? Here at Smile On Clinics, delivering quality dental care is our top priority. To help you maintain good oral health habits, we offer a wide range of dental health services that cover routine dentistry, cosmetic dental enhancements, and emergency assistance wherever necessary.

Reference to high-end technology that ensures exceptional dental care from start to finish. General Dentistry Appointments at Burwood Dental Clinic Most general dental appointments are about covering the basics, as an accompaniment to good oral health practice at home. These appointments generally cover an inspection to identify potential concerns at the earliest possible stage, while providing professional cleaning services to keep plaque and other dental issues at bay. As part of your quality dental care, your extensive exam will give a comprehensive analysis of your current oral health and any remedial actions that may help to improve or maintain your current dental health. Your dentist will complete a report, including any x-rays or photographs taken as part of the examination, and will give you access to all recorded information to keep you informed of your health throughout. As a Burwood family dentist, we aim to help children feel at ease throughout their dental appointments, because we understand that positive experiences will help encourage your children to care for their teeth more enthusiastically. We offer children access to similar treatments to adults, including check-ups, professional cleaning and scaling, fluoride treatments, and – if necessary – teeth straightening options. Dental Treatments for Common Dental Concerns In Burwood Another common reason for dental visits centres around dental pain. This pain can be excruciating and begin suddenly, or it may be a ‘background’ pain that is ever present, but you live with it. In either case, it’s always best to visit a dentist when you experience dental pain. In almost every case, there is a reason behind these aches, and the longer you wait to investigate, the worse the situation can become. At Smile On Clinics, we will investigate the source of pain as a priority and make our professional recommendations for a course of treatment to help relieve the pain and protect against future instances. Common treatments can include wisdom tooth removal, and application of fillings and crowns, depending on the source of the issue. In cases where you have a chipped or cracked tooth, we can also rebuild the tooth or apply a veneer to tackle the problem before it requires a more invasive course of treatment to correct. Enhance Your Smile with Our Industry-Leading Orthodontist in Burwood Dentistry isn’t all about general maintenance or combatting painful conditions, it can also be about helping you feel comfortable and confident in your smile. Using digital smile design, a technological game-changer, you can now design your own smile. This puts full control in your hands, allowing you to choose the look that matches your aesthetic, rather than having a dentist choose for you. Whether you want to straighten your teeth using Smile On Straighter clear aligners, utilise selective or full mouth dental implants, or you need a fully reconstructed set of teeth via dentures, we’ll help you every step of the way. To begin, we would complete an extensive analysis of your current dental situation, using x-rays and images, to produce a digital recreation. From there, you’ll work alongside our highly experienced team of dental technicians and specialists to make the adjustments that you want to see in your smile. When your digital smile design is complete and you are fully satisfied with the final version, we’ll work to recreate your carefully curated smile. Our Friendly Dentists in Burwood Give You All the Support You Need Though no one aims for poor dental health, dentist anxiety is real. If you experience this, please let us know so we can give you all the support you require for your dental needs. Part of our commitment to providing exceptional dental care is ensuring that you are as relaxed and as comfortable as possible throughout. If your dental anxiety is very powerful, causing avoidance or even dental neglect, it can lead to compounded dental problems later on. To help you overcome this, we provide a range of options like happy gas, IV sedation or a general anaesthesia service so you can sleep soundly throughout your procedure. This service is popular and allows people to take care of their mental health and their oral health with as minimal disruption as possible. We keep you informed of your information and recommendations throughout, so you can make fully informed decisions at every stage of your dental health journey. Book Your Appointment at Our Burwood Dental Clinic Today Unlike many other dental practices, Smile On Clinics provides you with the care of a local dentist while giving access to the latest technology for exceptional care. We offer a wide variety of services and utilise our own Smile On Lab to create your tailor-made implants. Outsourcing your dental care can lead to miscommunication issues, delays, and other issues that can negatively impact your life. However, we prioritise keeping your care in-house. This means that there are multiple collaboration opportunities, allowing you to benefit from the extensive knowledge of many specialists, all working together as one team. We aim to deliver exceptional care every time you visit. To find out more, or to book your first Smile On Clinics dental appointment, you can send your request through our easy-to-use contact form – we look forward to seeing you soon.

Our primary goal here at Smile On Clinics is to help our patients feel comfortable in the skin they’re in, as well as maintain decent oral health. As an independently owned and operated company, we don’t treat our patients as another number through the door, but instead, as individuals with unique dental care requirements.

Our Dubbo dental practice will take the time to understand your goals and will work together with you to create a tailor-made treatment plan during your 1:1 consultation with one of our experts. If you would like to discuss your needs further, please do seek our support via telephone or our ‘Contact us’ function on our website. A High-Tech Dentist in Dubbo If you choose Smile On Clinics for your dental treatments, you’ll no doubt receive exceptional dental care. This is because we utilise the most modern technology available to help our patients achieve their smile goals. Our excellent digital smile design enables us to show you what your teeth will look like following your procedure with us.

Put Your Faith in a Dubbo Family Dentist We are a proud Dubbo family dentist, which means that we welcome patients of all ages to our dental services. To maintain proper oral health as adults, it’s vital to educate the importance of this in childhood. Our team will make sure that your child enjoys their time with us, as well as learning vital skills such as proper tooth brushing, the effects of too much sugar, and why they should attend their regular check-ups. Doing this at an early age will not only help children become more comfortable when visiting the dentist, but they will also likely form much healthier habits when it comes to looking after their teeth. We aim to prevent tooth decay and other oral health concerns before they take place, and we feel that this education is the first step in achieving this.

Smile On Clinics is a local leader in both general dentistry and cosmetic treatments. From checkups to crowns, and cleanings to clear aligners, our experts have the skills and cutting-edge technology to make your next trip to a dentist in Griffith smooth and comfortable. Find a Qualified Orthodontist in Griffith Our dental clinics offer all common dental treatments designed to keep your smile white and healthy. Explore our range of treatment options below: General dental check-ups and cleanings Are you seeking a standard dental checkup? That’s no problem, and we’ll use the most advanced technology to assess your dental hygiene comprehensively and provide exceptional dental care. We also offer cleanings, which are designed to remove bacteria, plaque and tartar buildup from the surfaces of your teeth. It is recommended that you complete a teeth cleaning every six months for the best smile. Our general dentistry services also cover other services, such as crowns, veneers and implants. If you’re looking for a Griffith family dentist, Smile On Clinic’s range of generalist treatments ensures we can keep your family’s smiles in tip-top condition. Fillings for cavities Did you know that over 3/4 of the Australian population has had at least one filling? Our dentists can help install the filling type of your choice, aiming for a pain-free procedure. Teeth whitening If you’re looking to brighten your smile, we offer safe, effective teeth whitening. Using the most cutting-edge whitening methods, we restore unsightly stains to bright, clean tooth surfaces. Root canal therapy Root canal therapy is a highly effective dental treatment designed to save damaged or infected teeth, relieve pain and restore your natural smile. By gently removing the infection inside the tooth and sealing it, a root canal therapy procedure helps you avoid extractions, returning you to eating, speaking and smiling confidently. Tooth extractions Tooth extractions are a safe and routine procedure to remove damaged, decayed or problematic teeth, preserving your dental health in the long term. For example, a tooth extraction may be required if there’s a troublesome wisdom tooth removal. A tooth extraction will help relieve discomfort and pave the way for long-term solutions like dental implants or restorative treatments. Our tooth extractions are conducted using the best practices and technologies. Dental crowns and bridges Dental crowns are custom-made restorations designed to strengthen damaged or weakened teeth. As well as protecting damaged teeth, dental crowns will restore their natural look and function. Whether you need to repair a cracked tooth or complete a root canal treatment, crowns offer long-lasting protection and an effortlessly confident smile. Dental bridges fulfil a similar function. By filling gaps to restore your bite and enhance your appearance, dental bridges effectively substitute one or more missing teeth. Overall, bridges help you chew, speak and smile comfortably – without compromising your teeth’s natural appearance. Braces (metal, ceramic, lingual) Braces don’t have to be a source of embarrassment – find the braces that work for you with our range of options. When you chat to our dentists about orthodontic treatments they’ll help you find the right braces to serve you – and your smile. Smile On Straighter (clear aligners) Smile On Straighter Clear Aligners are a game-changing corrective treatment designed to move your teeth’s position comfortably. By gradually moving your teeth using a series of clear aligners, you can experience your straightest possible smile. The clear appearance reduces the aligners’ visibility for the most natural possible appearance. Retainers (post-treatment maintenance) After corrective orthodontics, consider maintaining your natural smile through custom-made retainers. These retainers will fit snugly around your teeth, preventing natural reversion towards their original position. Palatal expanders Palatal expanders are a staple of orthodontics. Designed to widen the upper arch, they’ll gently address overcrowding and crossbite. Jaw alignment treatments They’re just as they sound – jaw alignment treatments will use various implements (e.g. braces) to correct the jaw gently. Benefits of a corrected jaw include improved chewing, swallowing and breathing and improved function of the teeth. Early intervention orthodontics Whatever your requirements, Smile On Clinics has got you covered – and that includes dental needs like early intervention orthodontics (sometimes referred to as interceptive orthodontics). Early intervention orthodontics is an orthopaedic approach that ensures that the teeth and jaws develop correctly in children. Comprehensive oral exams Looking to understand your oral health in full? Smile On Clinics’ comprehensive dental care will ensure that you can make informed decisions about your dental health. Preventative dental care (cleanings, sealants) Effective preventative care will prevent the need for dental surgery – implants, extractions and so forth. Sealants will coat the surface of a vulnerable tooth, preventing further decay. Restorative services (fillings, crowns, bridges) Restorative services are essential in dentistry, and you should expect your local dental practice to provide all the basics – fillings, crowns and bridges. Cosmetic dentistry (veneers, whitening, bonding) Our Griffith dental clinic also offers a range of cosmetic dentistry treatments. For example, if you’re looking for high-quality veneers, we’re happy to assist. Orthodontic treatments (braces, aligners) Hundreds of thousands of Australians get braces, and once the braces have successfully realigned the teeth, we’ll fashion aligners to keep them in place. Emergency dental care (toothache, trauma repair) A dental emergency can be a source of intense anxiety. However, our expert approach will provide peace of mind when dealing with an out-of-hours emergency. It’s part of our commitment to serving local families – emergencies don’t always come at convenient times, and we’ve adjusted our availability to match.

This lets us serve the Manly area and more. Rather than a cold corporation, each of our clinics is operated by the dentists themselves. This gives each dental clinic a personal feel, and we have a light touch, providing training on new technologies and techniques and checking our core business values are being upheld. These values are teamwork, compassion, communication, and integrity. Teamwork is shown through our joint training and by the teams checking in with each other on the best treatment plans for patients. Compassion is shown through the approach to your dental care, making you feel comfortable and supported throughout. Communication is demonstrated through the fact that we’re always upfront with our patients. We talk you through the steps we want to take and why and how the proposed treatment plan lines up with your budget and goals. Finally, integrity underpins everything we do at our Manly dental practice. All our clinics are designed with patient comfort in mind, and we don’t take your trust in us for granted. We believe these values and our friendly approach make patients for life. Many of those who use our services have left reviews for our Manly dental clinic to prove that our values are working, and we hope this convinces more people to become Smile On patients for life. We Provide Exceptional Dental Care Across Multiple Specialties As we mentioned above, we put continual training as a high priority for all clinics in our network. This means our clinics are staffed by curious, knowledgeable team members who can cover almost all dental specialties between them. Make your life easier by choosing one dental practice that can do it all rather than having to make time for visiting one for check-ups, one for cosmetics, etc. We take child and adult patients, so your whole family can be seen. Routine check-ups are recommended twice a year at your Manly family dentist as this keeps on top of your mouth health and allows your dentist to look for any issues before they develop further. At our dental clinic in Manly, we’ll use a thorough technique to check your mouth and teeth, including x-rays, to see if there are any structural issues. An example of this would be wisdom teeth coming in at an angle, indicating the patient will need wisdom tooth removal to prevent issues such as making the surrounding teeth harder to clean. We also suggest professional cleanings as part of your general dentistry appointments. This helps remove plaque and tartar build-up that can be missed with brushing at home. It also helps promote good gum health and, for children, helps them become used to dental treatments, hopefully preventing nerves around the dentist developing later in life. With Smile On, our clinics are a great choice if you’re looking for a dentist who provides orthodontic treatments in Manly. During routine check-ups, if we notice signs of jaw misalignment in a child, we can quickly begin early intervention orthodontic care with the same trusted team. These treatments often reduce the time required for future orthodontic work and take advantage of the natural jaw growth phase to achieve major corrections more easily. For instance, palatal expanders—custom-designed for each patient—gently widen the upper jaw by applying pressure on either side. This technique helps correct mismatches in upper and lower jaw development, ensuring a balanced bite and creating enough space for adult teeth to emerge properly. We also offer straightening orthodontic treatments for both children and adults, with a variety of brace types available. Options depend on how quickly realignment is needed and whether patients prefer visible or more discreet solutions. Our dentist in Manly also offers cosmetic services, so we can help you restore or upgrade your smile, and we have a treatment for almost everyone. We’re experts in Teeth On Implants which can replace multiple missing teeth without needing one implant per tooth which means this option is available for people who’ve experienced some bone loss already whereas other dental implants need more bone density as there is one implant screwed into the jaw per artificial tooth. For those who don’t need restoration services, we can still offer smile upgrades. If you’re just looking for a tweak that helps reverse the staining from your morning coffees, we offer professional tooth whitening. This treatment typically helps your teeth shine for a few months. We can also provide more permanent upgrades, such as veneers that cover crooked or damaged teeth to provide a full, straight smile that most people crave. This shows that for Manly, dental is totally covered with our Smile On clinic. Our team will work with you to find the best treatments for your budget and lifestyle. We approach each patient as an individual and take the time to help you craft your ideal smile. Book Into Our Trusted Manly Dentist for Emergencies and Routine Dental Work Now we’ve looked at our pre-planned dental treatments, let’s consider what happens if your teeth give you a challenge you can’t plan for. Each Smile On clinic has some room in their schedule to accommodate emergencies for Manly residents, so you can benefit from our calming clinic environment at a stressful time. We will work to make you comfortable as quickly as possible, whether you’re dealing with a tooth infection or an injury. We’ll stop the bleeding or check for an abscess in cases of infection and leave you with antibiotics and/or treatment to help with swelling. You will likely then need to come back for further work, such as cavity treatment, once the antibiotics have kicked in. A dental emergency can be a stressful time, but we’ll do our best to help you recover quickly. Whether routine or urgent, you can trust Smile On clinics with your dental health. To get started, head to our ‘locations’ tab to find the closest clinic to you. Details of the team members, opening times, and how to contact them are on each clinic page. They’re eager to welcome you for your first appointment.

Proudly powered by Smile On Clinics, Smile On Mona Vale is your go-to dentist, offering high quality dental treatment in a caring and welcoming environment. Everything we do revolves around your patient journey and ensuring that each and every one of our patients can enjoy a tailor-made smile. Opening Hours Monday: 9:00am – 5pm Tuesday: 9:00am – 5pm Wednesday: 9:00am – 5pm Thursday: 9:00am – 5pm Friday: 9:00am – 5pm Saturday: CLOSED Sunday: CLOSED Just the Kind of Dentist Mona Vale Needs There is more than one reason for visiting a dentist, and these days it doesn’t have to mean trouble. It can be to do with looking good as much as feeling good, which begs the question of what kind of dentist Mona Vale needs. Or rather, what kind of dental clinic Mona Vale needs, because a clinic is about more than one person with a drill and some shiny instruments. In the early days of dentistry, it was all about extractions. Then came the age of the filling, when practical considerations were more important than how the tooth looked. These days, we all expect more. We want a fully functioning set of teeth that also looks great. If you haven’t embraced the possibilities yet – or perhaps it’s someone you know who is lagging behind – allow us to run through just some of the options that are now available at the kind of dentist Mona Vale has access to thanks to Smile On Clinics. The Purely Practical Let’s not forget that the primary reason for the existence of dentists is still for fixing things. Teeth are hard at work every day, making it possible for us to eat all the wonderful things that are on the menu these days. Everything needs to be processed by our teeth, and that includes healthy, unadulterated raw foods. If your teeth are crunching down on raw carrots or Brazil nuts, that is pressure, and it imposes stress on the teeth and gums. It’s a different kind of stress from the meat-eater tearing away at a steak, but it is wear and tear just the same, and problems are inevitably going to occur at some point. As for decay, modern toothpastes may be better at preventing cavities than those of years ago, and education means that at least people are aware that, for instance, sugary sweets are not as innocent as they seem. Fillings for cavities now benefit from the development of materials that are extremely resilient and also look very tooth-like, so they blend in rather than glaring at the world. So, teeth get cracked and holes appear, and these issues have to be dealt with by a dentist. Injuries happen, too, and when they do, the dentist is there to make things better. Tooth extractions may be the last resort, but when it’s got to go, it’s got to go. Unfortunately, many people still don’t take good care of their teeth, and even if you do, it is wise to have a check-up regularly, because a good dentist can spot trouble before it becomes a problem and take steps to resolve the situation. The Value of a Confident Smile Smiling is good. It is a natural indication of happiness. But that doesn’t mean that non-smiley people are less happy. It can just be that they are reluctant to let it happen because it will expose their teeth, and they are self-conscious about them. That could be for reasons of alignment, such as protruding front teeth or a general irregularity. Everyone is born with teeth, and once the original ones, the “milk teeth”, have gone, we are provided with 32 new ones that are to serve us all our adult life. Ideally, these are neatly arranged, but that isn’t always the case, and braces or aligners are needed to straighten things out. The alignment process is often carried out when we’re young, which is technically called early intervention orthodontics, but new developments, including the brilliant Invisalign treatment, have led to more and more people opting for this in their 20s and beyond. Smile On Straighter Clear Aligners are far less obvious than old-style braces. They are made of clear material and are very comfortable, with the added advantage that you can take it out for eating, brushing your teeth or other activities, as long as you put it back promptly and it is in position for 20-22 hours a day. Cosmetic Treatments If your teeth are unattractive because of their colour or irregular shape, there are ways of dealing with them. Teeth whitening procedures can be very effective when carried out by a professional. Another option is veneers, which are thin shells, usually made of porcelain or composite resin, that are tailor-made to fit over a particular tooth and are absolutely convincing. They are so comfortable that the wearer quickly forgets about them, and the rest of the world is none the wiser; they just see a nice set of teeth. Rebuild or Replace Dental crowns have long been used to rebuild teeth, using the existing root as the base onto which a solid replacement is added. An even better solution in many cases is what is known as dental implants. The implants themselves take the place of the root; they are made of titanium and are screwed into the jawbone, where a natural process called osseointegration binds them even more firmly. Replacement teeth are then fitted to the implants and the result is as good as the original tooth and root: firm, resilient and coloured to match the surrounding teeth, so you can eat with confidence and beam that big smile or laugh out loud, safe in the knowledge that your teeth look great. Find a Clinic That Can Do It All The answer to the question of what kind of dental clinic Mona Vale needs is an all-round dental clinic that can provide all the services we have just looked at. And now you’ve found it. Smile On Clinics is a group of all-round dental clinics, and the Mona Vale practice is at 1731 Pittwater Road.

If you are a Nelson Bay resident needing dental treatments, but you feel anxious or nervous about going to the dentist, then worry not, you are not the only one. Many people avoid going to the dentist because of an unfounded fear or a bad experience in the past, but this doesn’t help oral health as untreated issues can lead to gum disease, cavities and even tooth loss. The exceptional dental care our dentists in Nelson Bay can provide will restore your smile and boost your confidence, and not only improve your dental health but your general health too, as poor oral hygiene can increase the risk of certain conditions like heart disease, diabetes and respiratory infections. At Smile On clinics, we aim to make your visit as comfortable and stress-free as possible, so for those who feel too anxious to visit a dental clinic, we offer sleep dentistry. This form of dental treatment involves intravenous sedation and anaesthesia, so the patient is asleep during the procedure, which reduces pain, awareness and recollection. It can be a serious deterrent if you feel nervous about visiting the dentist, so our Nelson Bay family dentist can perform sedation in the dental chair for any member of the family and any procedure, from a simple clean and polish to a wisdom tooth removal. However, for more complex cases or for those patients who would rather be completely sedated for their procedure, general anaesthetic facilities are performed at a private hospital where we can deliver our quality dental care, and you won’t know a thing about it! Nelson Bay Dental Practice Services At Smile On Clinics, our highly trained team offers a wide range of dental services to help restore your smile and improve your dental health. We believe in preventative care and recommend regular check-ups with your Nelson Bay dentist for general cleaning and polishing, and to check that there are no underlying issues with your teeth, gums and overall health. Poor oral hygiene can significantly impact your general health, as bacteria from gum disease can enter the bloodstream and increase the risk of heart problems or stroke or be inhaled into the lungs and lead to respiratory illness. Your friendly dentist in Nelson Bay is the first line of defence against dental disease and helping you to improve your general well-being. You and your family can enjoy comprehensive dental care at our Nelson Bay dental clinic, where you can expect to receive the very best of care combined with the latest technology for dental implants, cosmetic dentistry, dental crowns and bridges, orthodontic treatments and dental emergencies such as tooth ache and trauma repair. At your trusted Nelson Bay dentist, you will find expert care for your children’s teeth and general practice orthodontics, because we understand how important it is to build up a good relationship with your dentist when you are young, and for your children to understand and learn the importance of good oral hygiene. We make these visits fun and light-hearted, and encourage little ones to develop positive lifelong habits like brushing twice a day and being aware of the damage sugary foods and drinks can cause to their teeth. By practicing positive reinforcement, such as rewarding their bravery at the end of their visit, children will look forward to the next visit to the dental practice rather than dreading it. What Is Cosmetic Dentistry? While the focus on cosmetic dentistry is to improve the appearance of your smile by enhancing the aesthetics of your teeth and gums, and enhancing symmetry and balance, it also goes a long way to improve both mental and physical health. Individuals who are embarrassed by wonky or stained teeth often lack confidence and may even have speech or chewing issues. To improve the colour, position, shape, size and alignment of teeth, you may need to undergo any of the following treatments: teeth whitening Clear aligners dental veneers dental implants Teeth that are chipped, cracked or discoloured can be improved by placing a very thin, custom-made shell over the front of them to improve their appearance, and once these dental veneers are in place, they look completely natural and improve any smile. Smile On Straighter Clear Aligners uses custom-made aligners that are clear and removable, and work to straighten the teeth in a painless yet effective manner. Having bright, evenly coloured teeth goes a long way to boosting a person’s confidence, and our in-chair treatments remove stains and reduce discolouration without damaging tooth enamel. Once you have a beautiful smile, you are more likely to take care of your teeth to maintain your new appearance. Wonky teeth that cross each other create crevices that are hard to clean, where bacteria can build up and cause tooth decay and other dental issues. This type of dental care not only makes you look and feel better, but it is also better for your dental health too. Smile On Clinics for All Your Dental Needs Finding a clinic that can provide you with exceptional dental care is vital to the oral and general health of you and your family. Our teeth are one of our most important features, and with regular visits to your dentist in Nelson Bay and by developing good oral hygiene habits, you can have a happy and healthy smile throughout your life. Having treatments as and when you need them ensures that little problems don’t develop into big issues, so at the first signs of dental issues like toothache, sensitivity, bleeding or swollen gums or persistent bad breath, you should book an appointment. Whether you require a simple filling, root canal therapy or a comprehensive oral exam, the sooner you start treatment, the easier it will be. Don’t let financial issues get in the way – we offer all sorts of services to suit all sorts of budgets and accept health funds and offer monthly payment plans to ease the financial strain. Whatever your dental needs are, we’re here to help put that smile back on your face!

Our friendly staff members will welcome your children with open arms, making them feel at ease with our inviting toys in our waiting room. We will explain in simple terms exactly what will happen during their time with us, and will also provide useful information around tooth brushing, the effects of too much sugar, and why visiting the dentist is important for their overall health and well-being. We also recommend that your child bring something from home, such as a toy or game, to help them feel even more secure at our dental practice. Once we have finished, we will give them a small reward to celebrate a job well done. Children deserve the best start in life when it comes to their oral health, and we believe that we at Smile On Clinics are most equipped to provide this.

Experience Exceptional Dental Care at Your Saratoga Dental Clinic Are you looking for a trusted Saratoga dentist who can provide comprehensive dental care for your entire family? Our Saratoga dental practice combines all the benefits of the latest in dental technology, while offering our patients care and compassion at every appointment. To help ensure you get the highest quality dental care, we’ve developed our practice to cover all of the most common dental work, and even some of the less common treatments, too. On top of that, we have our own Smile On Lab which ensures your implants are completed quickly and accurately. Whether you’re looking for a routine appointment for a mid-year check-up or you need some help to put the confidence back in your smile, Smile On Clinics is ready to deliver, with all your dental needs taken care of in one place. Personalised Dental Treatments at Our Saratoga Dental Clinic What sets our practice apart is our personalised approach to dental health. We prioritise delivering specifically tailored care to every patient who visits our Saratoga dental clinic. We take the time to listen to you as you tell us your dental concerns. Our team aims to understand your dental history, current issues, and dental goals before recommending any treatment options. For Saratoga residents seeking exceptional dental care, our facility offers the perfect combination of technical expertise and genuine care for our patients. Whether you’re new to the area or looking to switch to a Saratoga family dentist who truly listens, our doors are open to welcome you. Maintain Your Smile with Regular Preventative Treatments For some, the thought of visiting the dentist can cause them to break out in a sweat. We get it – and we’re here to help you every step of the way. If this is you, please speak with our team to let us know how we can help you access the dental services you require. Preventative treatments are centred around keeping your teeth healthy and bright – these include having a professional cleaning, tartar build-up removal, and polishing. For some, this is enough to keep those pearly whites in peak condition. At each check-up, we’ll take a look for the common problems – cavities, cracks, etc. – as well as give you a more comprehensive check-up for more serious (occasionally less obvious) problems or concerns that we should keep an eye on. Prevention tactics (regular check-ups, brushing and flossing twice a day at least) are essential for long-term excellent dental health. Regular visits to your dentist in Saratoga can help identify potential issues before they develop into serious problems requiring extensive (and sometimes expensive) dental treatments. Our preventative services include: Thorough dental examinations using advanced diagnostic technology Professional teeth cleaning to remove plaque and tartar buildup Digital X-rays for comprehensive assessment Oral cancer screenings Personalised oral hygiene education By focusing on preventative care, we help Saratoga residents maintain healthy teeth and gums, potentially saving them from discomfort and more costly treatments in the future. Comprehensive Restorative Solutions for Complex Dental Needs Even with excellent home care, dental issues can sometimes arise. When they do, our Saratoga dental practice offers a complete range of restorative dental treatments to repair damage and restore function: Tooth-coloured fillings for cavities Crown and bridge work for damaged or missing teeth Root canal therapy for infected teeth Dentures and partial dentures Wisdom tooth removal Dental implants As your trusted Saratoga dentist, we use only the highest quality materials and the latest techniques to ensure long-lasting results. Whether you need a simple filling or complete mouth rehabilitation, our goal is to restore both function and aesthetics while preserving as much of your natural tooth structure as possible. Advanced Dental Implant Technology Available in Saratoga Having missing teeth doesn’t necessarily mean poor dental hygiene practices – teeth can be knocked out during contact sports, or by tripping over your shoelaces. Small, insignificant cracks in teeth can slowly become larger over time, which can result in a split tooth. This might loosen and eventually fall out. No matter how our patients have lost their teeth in the first place, one thing unites them all… each one of them has felt some impact on the way they socialise, and the confidence they feel (or lack thereof) when they smile. Missing teeth can affect both your oral health and self-confidence. Our Saratoga dental clinic specialises in dental implants – the gold standard for tooth replacement. These solutions offer several advantages over traditional bridges or dentures: Look and function like natural teeth Preserve jawbone structure Prevent shifting of adjacent teeth No adhesives or special cleaning routines required Can last a lifetime with proper care For Saratoga residents considering implants, we will provide comprehensive consultations to determine if this option is right for you. Our experienced team will guide you through every point of the journey, from initial consultation to the final placement. Using the latest in dental technology, you’ll have a say in how your smile appears at the end of your implant journey. Unlike elsewhere, where the dentist has final say, you’ll be able to ‘trial’ a version of your new smile with our software, so you can choose the results you desire before work even begins. Cosmetic Dentistry: Transform Your Smile Your smile is often the first thing people notice about you. If you’re unhappy with the appearance of your teeth, our cosmetic dental services can help transform your smile and boost your confidence: Professional teeth whitening Porcelain veneers Dental bonding Clear aligner orthodontics Smile makeovers Your Saratoga family dentist understands that aesthetic concerns are just as important as functional ones. We take pride in creating beautiful, natural-looking results that complement your facial features and personality. Children’s Dentistry: Building Healthy Habits Early As a family-oriented practice, we place special emphasis on the dental care of Saratoga’s youngsters. Your Saratoga family dentist creates positive, gentle experiences for young patients to build a foundation for lifelong oral health. Our children’s services include: Kid-friendly first dental visits Preventative treatments like sealants and fluoride Education about proper brushing and flossing techniques Early orthodontic assessment We understand that early experiences at the dentist can shape attitudes toward dental care for years to come. That’s why we strive to make each visit fun, educational, and stress-free for our youngest patients. Emergency Dental Care When You Need It Most Have you ever noticed that a dental emergency rarely happens at convenient times? When you’re facing severe pain, a broken tooth, or other urgent dental issues, prompt treatment is essential. Our Saratoga dental practice offers emergency appointments for: Severe toothaches Knocked-out or fractured teeth Lost fillings or crowns Dental infections and abscesses Injuries to the mouth or jaw If you’re in Saratoga and experiencing a dental emergency, swift action – calling your Smile On Clinics dentist asap – can make a significant difference to the type of dental care you need, and the amount of time you’ll spend dealing with the problem.

From cleaning to dental implants, our expert team ensures top-quality, personalised care. Using modern techniques, we create confident, lasting smiles with lasting results: Preventative dental care Cleanings: Our dental cleaning services keep your smile healthy by removing plaque, tartar, and stains. We gently clean your teeth and gums, preventing cavities, gum disease, and bad breath, ensuring a fresh, bright smile. Sealants: Avoid cavities with our fissue sealants. This protective shield is painlessly fitted and is ideal for children and adults, helping to maintain strong, decay-free teeth. Restorative services Fillings: To repair your cavities and restore your tooth structure, dental fillings are the answer. Made from durable, natural-looking materials, they blend seamlessly with your smile while preventing further decay. Crowns: Damaged or weakened teeth, can be strengthened by dental crowns. They provide protection, and a natural look. Custom-made for durability and aesthetics, they enhance both the function and appearance of your teeth for a confident, long-lasting smile. Bridges: If you have missing teeth, we can apply dental bridges to restore your smile’s function and appearance. Seamlessly fitting, bridges improve chewing, speech, and alignment while preventing surrounding teeth from shifting out of place. Cosmetic dentistry Veneers: Thin, custom-made shells that enhance your smile, veneers cover imperfections like stains, chips, or gaps. They provide a natural, durable, and radiant look for a flawless, confident smile. Bonding: This quick, affordable solution is used to repair chips, cracks, or gaps in teeth. Using a tooth-coloured resin, it enhances your smile, restoring both function and appearance with minimal discomfort. Whitening: Our whitening services will give you back your brilliant smile by removing stains and discoloration. By using safe, yet effective treatments, we can enhance your teeth’s natural whiteness, boosting confidence and giving you a radiant, youthful appearance. Orthodontic treatments Braces: Dental braces are a great solution for correcting misaligned teeth. With metal or ceramic options available, braces gradually shift teeth into their proper position, correcting bite issues, enhancing oral health, and giving you a more confident, beautiful smile. Aligners: For a modern alternative to traditional braces, we recommend clear aligners. Custom-made to fit your teeth, the plastic trays gradually shift them into alignment. Aligners are conveniently removable, making eating and cleaning a lot easier. They provide a clear, convenient solution for achieving a straighter, healthier smile. Emergency dental care Toothache and Trauma Repair: If you have an urgent dental issue, we can provide immediate attention.

Comprehensive Dental Care for all We really do mean it when we say that we offer a wide selection of dental services. If you choose to visit our Your Tanworth Dentist, here are just some of the treatments you can expect: General dentistry General dentistry covers pretty much everything you think of when visiting the dentist. It includes your routine check-ups, preventative work, cleaning, fillings and wisdom tooth removal. Remember, booking regular appointments at your dental clinic will give your teeth the very best chance to remain healthy and attractive, so if you haven’t visited a dentist for a while, give us a call now! Cosmetic dentistry Individuals visit us for cosmetic work when their teeth are healthy but perhaps fancy a little makeover. We can use teeth whitening treatments, bonding or veneers to improve the overall look of your teeth. Restorative dentistry Have broken, chipped or missing teeth? Then our dentist in Tamworth can help. Depending on your situation, you may choose dental implants, crowns or bridges. If you’re not sure what’s best, then just give us a call! Orthodontics You may see our orthodontics team for teeth straightening services. We have a selection of variants to choose from depending on your requirements and budget. This includes fixed braces and clear aligners. Jaw alignment treatments will also be treated under this category. Teeth straightening If you’re dealing with crowded teeth, gaps, or bite issues, teeth straightening can make a world of difference. Our orthodontic options include both traditional braces and modern clear aligners, offering flexibility based on your lifestyle and goals. Straightening your teeth not only enhances your appearance but also improves your oral health, as properly aligned teeth are easier to clean and maintain. Veneers For those looking to refresh their smile quickly and effectively, veneer treatment offers a long-lasting solution. Veneers are ultra-thin shells bonded to the front of your teeth to correct issues like staining, minor chips, and uneven spacing. At our trusted Tamworth dental clinic, we create custom veneers that blend seamlessly with your natural teeth for a flawless, confidence-boosting finish. Dentures If you’re missing several teeth or need a full replacement, denture procedures can restore both function and appearance. We offer both full and partial dentures tailored to fit comfortably and securely. Our experienced dentists in Tamworth will work with you to ensure your dentures are natural-looking, easy to wear, and help you eat and speak with confidence again. Emergency dental care You’ve heard us correctly. We provide care during your dental emergency, whether you’re an existing patient or not! Simply call our hotline, which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and one of our team will do their utmost to get you exceptional dental care in the quickest time possible.

We ensure that our professionals are highly trained and use the most effective technology available, as we aim for the best outcomes possible for our patients.

This allows us to work out any issues and set your expectations on what your new and improved smile will look like! At Smile On Clinics, no patient is treated in the same way, because unlike some other dental health providers, we actually take the time to understand your individual requirements. If you would like to take advantage of our consultations, then please do get in touch with us at our Your Tamworth Dentist clinic, where you will meet with one of our professionals to discuss your needs, goals and budget. Following this, a tailor-made treatment plan will be created to suit you. This means that you will receive the most appropriate care for your needs. Who could ask for more?! You’ll be Safe in the Hands of a Tamworth Family Dentist Providing quality dental care for our youngest patients is extremely important to us, as it prevents concerns such as tooth decay and teaches children proper oral health practices that they can take into adulthood. Another benefit of bringing your child to a Tamworth family dentist early on is that they can become comfortable with our practice and know what to expect during an appointment. Our friendly staff members will welcome your children with open arms, making them feel at ease with our inviting toys in our waiting room. We will explain in simple terms exactly what will happen during their time with us, and will also provide useful information around tooth brushing, the effects of too much sugar, and why visiting the dentist is important for their overall health and well-being. We also recommend that your child bring something from home, such as a toy or game, to help them feel even more secure at our dental practice. Once we have finished, we will give them a small reward to celebrate a job well done. Children deserve the best start in life when it comes to their oral health, and we believe that we at Smile On Clinics are most equipped to provide this. Multiple Payment Options – Including Health Funds We are happy to announce that we accept all mainstream health funds; however, if you are covering the cost of your dental treatments yourself, then we have several choices for you. We have some discounts available if you pay for your services in full, however, we do also provide a choice of handy payment plans to suit your circumstances. If you would like to discuss your options, please call our dental practice. Your Soon to be Favourite Tamworth Dental Clinic So, there you have it.

Offering A Complete Range of Dental Treatments At our Taree dental clinic, we cater to all your dental needs to keep your smile healthy and bright. From routine checkups and cleanings to advanced cosmetic and restorative procedures, our expert team provides exceptional care for all ages. Whatever your dental issues, we’re here to help: General Dentistry: We focus on maintaining your oral health with preventive, restorative, and routine measures. These services include regular checkups, professional cleanings, fillings, gum disease treatment, and cavity prevention. We also provide essential treatments such as root canals, wisdom tooth removal, and crowns to restore damaged teeth. Preventive care is a key part of our general dentistry, helping patients avoid serious dental issues through early detection. Regular trips to your dentist allow them to monitor your oral health, provide tailored advice, and in turn, you achieve a glowing, healthy smile. From fixing a toothache to offering cosmetic solutions like whitening, general dentistry covers all aspects of dental care. With expert treatment and guidance, you can maintain a confident, healthy smile for years to come. Comprehensive oral exams: Our comprehensive oral exams are essential for maintaining long-term dental health. These thorough evaluations assess your teeth, gums, jaw, and overall oral structures to detect potential issues early. During the exam, we’ll check for cavities, gum disease, bite alignment, and signs of oral cancer. X-rays may be taken to examine underlying structures, ensuring a complete diagnosis. Regular comprehensive exams help prevent small issues from becoming major dental problems, saving you time, money, and discomfort in the future. Our professional dentists will also review your medical history, discuss oral hygiene habits, and provide unique care recommendations. Jaw alignment treatments: If your jaw is misaligned, there are several treatments available to correct bite issues, improve facial symmetry, and relieve discomfort. Common treatments include braces, clear aligners, palatal expanders, and orthodontic appliances that gradually shift the jaw into the proper position. Treatment can last for a few months, with adjustments made regularly for gradual expansion and movement. If your case is more severe, a Taree dental surgeon may suggest surgical options like orthognathic (jaw) surgery to correct significant misalignment. Early intervention, especially in children and teens, can prevent long-term issues like difficulty with chewing or speech problems. Treatments will vary based on individual needs, and our team will tailor plans to ensure the best results. At Smile On Clinics, our techniques and use of technology make jaw alignment treatments more effective and comfortable than ever. Whether minor or complex, addressing misalignment can improve both function and appearance, leading to a healthier, more confident smile. Early intervention orthodontics: With early intervention orthodontics, we can work on guiding jaw and teeth development in children to prevent serious dental issues later. Also known as Phase 1 orthodontic treatment, it typically begins around ages 6 to 10 when your child’s jaw is still growing. Our treatments may include palatal expanders, space maintainers, or partial braces to correct bite problems, crowding, or misalignment before permanent teeth fully emerge. By addressing issues early, we can reduce the need for more invasive treatments, such as extractions or surgery, in the future. Early intervention also improves facial symmetry, chewing function, and speech development. Regular dental checkups can help identify if your child may benefit from early orthodontic care. Emergency Treatments: The Smile On Clinics dentist in Taree provides fast relief for sudden dental issues like severe toothaches, broken teeth, lost fillings, or infections. We know that dental emergencies can happen anytime, anywhere, and immediate care is crucial to prevent further damage and pain, which is why we offer treatments such as tooth extractions, root canals, repairs for chipped or fractured teeth, and treatment for abscesses or gum infections. If you experience intense pain, swelling, or bleeding, our emergency dental care can save your tooth and protect your overall health. Our expert practitioners use advanced techniques to quickly diagnose and treat urgent problems, ensuring you get the relief you need. Dental emergencies should not be ignored, and timely treatment can prevent complications and restore your comfort Book Your Appointment with Smile On Clinics Book an appointment today with a Smile On Clinics trusted Taree dentist and maintain optimal oral health.

Our dental practice focuses on making your experience as relaxed and pain-free as possible so you can enjoy a stress-free visit. 2. Myth: You only need to go to a dental clinic if you have pain or a problem. Truth: General dental check-ups and cleanings are essential for maintaining good dental health and preventing future problems. Our dental clinic offers comprehensive care, from routine checks to more advanced treatments like root canal therapy or orthodontic treatments. Preventative dental care is key to avoiding invasive treatments in later life. 3. Myth: Dental care is expensive, and I can't afford it. Truth: At Smile On, we understand that quality dental care can be a significant investment, which is why we offer flexible payment plans to help manage the cost of treatments like dental implants, fillings, and orthodontic services. Plus, we work with various health funds to maximise your benefits entitlements and ensure dental care is accessible and affordable for everybody. 4. Myth: Cosmetic dental treatments, like teeth whitening or veneers, are only for celebrities. Truth: Cosmetic dentistry is accessible to everyone at Smile On. We offer a range of cosmetic services to help you achieve the beautiful smile you've always wanted. You should be aware that results may vary between patients, and you should always discuss your options with your dentist in Buderim before proceeding with any treatment. 5. Myth: Wisdom tooth removal is unnecessary unless you're in pain. Truth: While wisdom teeth may cause pain, their removal is often recommended even before problems arise. Impacted wisdom teeth can affect your oral health, ability to chew properly, and overall quality of life. Our dental practice offers tooth extractions to prevent future complications and will endeavour to reduce as much pain as possible. 6. Myth: Braces are the only option for straightening teeth. Truth: While traditional lingual braces and those made from metal or ceramics are effective, at Smile On, we offer a range of orthodontic treatments, including Smile On Straighter clear aligners and early intervention orthodontics for children, including palatal expanders to reduce overcrowding by creating more space in their mouths. Our team provides personalised recommendations based on your dental needs and those of your family, ensuring you all get the most comfortable and effective solution for a straighter smile. 7. Myth: I don't need to visit the dentist if I don't have cavities. Truth: Even if you're cavity-free, regular dental exams are essential for detecting other issues like gum disease, tooth sensitivity, or alignment problems that may not yet be causing you problems. At our dental practice we offer comprehensive oral exams to ensure your overall oral health is in top condition and to prevent future issues. 8. Myth: Root canal therapy is always painful and unnecessary. Truth: Root canal therapy is often a misunderstood procedure. At Smile On, we provide quality dental care for root canal treatments, which is known to relieve the pain caused by an infected tooth. The procedure is relatively painless due to effective anaesthesia, and it is the ideal solution to save your tooth from extraction, helping to preserve your smile. 9. Myth: Once I have dental implants, I'll need to avoid certain foods forever. Truth: When they're placed by our experienced team, implants offer a long-lasting, natural-looking solution for tooth loss. After a period of healing, implants are as strong as natural teeth, allowing you to enjoy all your favourite foods without restriction, providing a durable and functional solution for missing teeth. However, it's always recommended that you maintain a healthy, balanced diet and limit your consumption of sugary and fatty foods and beverages for your health in general. 10. Myth: I only need braces if my teeth are visibly crooked. Truth: Orthodontic treatments like braces, clear aligners, or jaw alignment treatments are about more than just cosmetic appearance. Misaligned teeth can lead to problems with bite, chewing, and even speech. Early intervention orthodontics can help to address these issues before they become more serious. 11. Myth: Tooth extractions require a long recovery period. Truth: While tooth extractions are sometimes necessary, the recovery period is typically short and easily manageable. With proper care and aftercare instructions from our Buderim dental clinic, our patients have reported a quick and smooth recovery. If it's a simple extraction or part of a larger dental plan (such as preparing for dental implants), we aim to ensure minimal discomfort and facilitate a fast recovery. 12. Myth: Dental crowns and bridges are only for people with major dental issues. Truth: Dental crowns and bridges are excellent solutions not only for people with severely damaged teeth but also for those who want to restore the function and appearance of their smile. Whether for restorative purposes or aesthetic reasons, these treatments can improve both the look and function of your teeth. 13. Myth: I can skip preventative dental care, like cleanings and sealants, if I brush and floss regularly. Truth: Even the most thorough brushing and flossing can't remove all plaque or tartar buildup. Preventative dental care, like professional cleanings and sealants, is vital for preventing cavities from forming and gum disease. At Smile On, we offer comprehensive dental check-ups and cleanings to maintain your oral health. 14. Myth: Dental emergencies are rare, so I won't need emergency care. Truth: Dental emergencies, such as toothaches, trauma, or broken teeth, can happen with little to no warning. We offer emergency dental care to quickly address these situations. Whether it's fixing a broken tooth or managing severe pain, our team is here to provide prompt and effective solutions. Supporting You to Cover the Cost of Dental Care We understand that dental care can come at a significant financial cost, which is why we offer flexible payment plans to help you manage the cost of your treatments, spread over a timeframe that works for you. Our team will work with you to find a plan that suits your budget, allowing you to access the care you need without causing you financial stress. In addition, we work with various health funds to make dental care even more affordable and accessible for everybody.

Choosing a Smile On Clinics Burwood dental practice gives you the comforts of a small, local team as well as the benefits of an expanding brand, available across Australia.

Reference to high-end technology that ensures exceptional dental care from start to finish. General Dentistry Appointments at Burwood Dental Clinic Most general dental appointments are about covering the basics, as an accompaniment to good oral health practice at home. These appointments generally cover an inspection to identify potential concerns at the earliest possible stage, while providing professional cleaning services to keep plaque and other dental issues at bay. As part of your quality dental care, your extensive exam will give a comprehensive analysis of your current oral health and any remedial actions that may help to improve or maintain your current dental health. Your dentist will complete a report, including any x-rays or photographs taken as part of the examination, and will give you access to all recorded information to keep you informed of your health throughout. As a Burwood family dentist, we aim to help children feel at ease throughout their dental appointments, because we understand that positive experiences will help encourage your children to care for their teeth more enthusiastically. We offer children access to similar treatments to adults, including check-ups, professional cleaning and scaling, fluoride treatments, and – if necessary – teeth straightening options. Dental Treatments for Common Dental Concerns In Burwood Another common reason for dental visits centres around dental pain. This pain can be excruciating and begin suddenly, or it may be a ‘background’ pain that is ever present, but you live with it. In either case, it’s always best to visit a dentist when you experience dental pain. In almost every case, there is a reason behind these aches, and the longer you wait to investigate, the worse the situation can become. At Smile On Clinics, we will investigate the source of pain as a priority and make our professional recommendations for a course of treatment to help relieve the pain and protect against future instances. Common treatments can include wisdom tooth removal, and application of fillings and crowns, depending on the source of the issue. In cases where you have a chipped or cracked tooth, we can also rebuild the tooth or apply a veneer to tackle the problem before it requires a more invasive course of treatment to correct. Enhance Your Smile with Our Industry-Leading Orthodontist in Burwood Dentistry isn’t all about general maintenance or combatting painful conditions, it can also be about helping you feel comfortable and confident in your smile. Using digital smile design, a technological game-changer, you can now design your own smile. This puts full control in your hands, allowing you to choose the look that matches your aesthetic, rather than having a dentist choose for you. Whether you want to straighten your teeth using Smile On Straighter clear aligners, utilise selective or full mouth dental implants, or you need a fully reconstructed set of teeth via dentures, we’ll help you every step of the way. To begin, we would complete an extensive analysis of your current dental situation, using x-rays and images, to produce a digital recreation. From there, you’ll work alongside our highly experienced team of dental technicians and specialists to make the adjustments that you want to see in your smile. When your digital smile design is complete and you are fully satisfied with the final version, we’ll work to recreate your carefully curated smile. Our Friendly Dentists in Burwood Give You All the Support You Need Though no one aims for poor dental health, dentist anxiety is real. If you experience this, please let us know so we can give you all the support you require for your dental needs. Part of our commitment to providing exceptional dental care is ensuring that you are as relaxed and as comfortable as possible throughout. If your dental anxiety is very powerful, causing avoidance or even dental neglect, it can lead to compounded dental problems later on. To help you overcome this, we provide a range of options like happy gas, IV sedation or a general anaesthesia service so you can sleep soundly throughout your procedure. This service is popular and allows people to take care of their mental health and their oral health with as minimal disruption as possible. We keep you informed of your information and recommendations throughout, so you can make fully informed decisions at every stage of your dental health journey. Book Your Appointment at Our Burwood Dental Clinic Today Unlike many other dental practices, Smile On Clinics provides you with the care of a local dentist while giving access to the latest technology for exceptional care. We offer a wide variety of services and utilise our own Smile On Lab to create your tailor-made implants.

Routine check-ups and professional teeth cleaning perfectly complement your daily brushing and flossing. Additionally, dentists at Smile On Clinics are committed to your comprehensive dental care. During your routine appointments, our industry-leading team use the latest technological developments to assist in the detection of emerging tooth or gum concerns. By identifying these issues early, we can tackle them before they become an overwhelming problem. We adopt the patient-first approach, giving you the information you need to stay informed of any potential dental treatments that our dentists may recommend. So, if you’re looking for a dental clinic on the Central Coast, then look no further, we are here to help with all your dental needs. Here at Smile On Clinics, we prioritise positive experiences, providing exceptional dental care to patients across Australia every day. Services You Can Access at Our Dentist In Central Coast Regular visits to your dentist are recommended to maintain your oral health. However, problems can - and do – develop, so it may be that you need specialised services to prevent further oral deterioration and to reverse the signs of damage. Poor oral health can impact quality of life in a variety of ways. Some patients find that they’ve lost their confidence, while others have reported feelings of self-consciousness when they smile. If you want to make a positive change to the health of your teeth and gums, there are many dental treatments available. And if you have avoided your local Central Coast dental clinic due to dentist anxiety, then you’ll be pleased to know that we are licensed to offer full sedation to Central Coast residents during their dental work. This is a game-changer for many who have neglected dental pain or who have lived with problems that impact their quality of life, due to dental anxiety. This is a common concern for many, and that’s why we’re pleased to offer this service at our Central Coast dental practice. Rather than specialising in one specific dental treatment, Smile On Clinics offers multiple dental services under one roof. From general dentistry, such as check-ups, to crafting bespoke dental implants in our own Smile On Labs, we take pride in providing exceptional dental care from the simplest to the most complex of dental treatment plans. Family-Friendly Orthodontist in Central Coast Teaching children how to care for their teeth is crucial so that they learn independent oral health care practices that will benefit them throughout their lives. Many children have a sweet tooth, and whether that’s candy or fruits, sugar is a major contributor to the formation of cavities. We understand that, in practice, it’s difficult to avoid all substances that can impact the health of teeth, so that’s why we advocate for all children to feel safe and comfortable at their dental appointments. If your child requires a bespoke dental care plan, our Central Coast family dentist offers cavity-filling services, such as fillings, to intervene in the deterioration of the tooth, helping to prevent further damage occurring in the weekend areas. If the tooth has been seriously damaged, you could opt to have a crown fitted too. As our children grow, adult teeth don’t always set in perfectly. To help align teeth that may be causing your teen concern, we can also offer to fit braces (which are aesthetically distant from the stereotypical “look”). Additionally, we are proud to offer Smile On Straighter, the clear dental aligners that are almost invisible at first glance. We can help you and your family choose the best option for your circumstances. Clear aligners are an incredibly popular option at our dental clinic because it combines a cosmetic enhancement without the permanent application (and maintenance) of braces. Bespoke Dental Implants Crafted in Our Smile On Lab Losing teeth, no matter the reason, can be a knock to the confidence, with some patients reporting that they avoid smiling in social situations due to embarrassment. Smiling is a human instinct, and we’re here to provide quality dental care to suit your dental needs. Using the latest technology, we are able to offer our exclusive Teeth On Implants, which replicate your teeth to rebuild a natural and beautiful smile. We meticulously photograph and x-ray your mouth to ensure that we have all the exact measurements, including your face shape and smile line, to carefully craft your replacement teeth. They match so closely that no one will guess that you’re sporting implants! Teeth On Implants are particularly well suited if you have broken or chipped teeth, or even if you have a tooth loss. During our analysis, we’ll share all our data with you, including the photos and x-rays, so you can make an informed choice about your dental treatment plan. Our quality dental care doesn’t stop there, you can also make use of our Smile On Digital Smile Design technology. This innovative application allows you to ‘try out’ different smiles before you commit to a specific care and treatment plan. Rather than relying on a dentist’s impressions of how you should look, our team at Smile On Clinics put you in control. Simply use the functions to try different smiles against your picture to find the aesthetic look that boosts your confidence. Your dentist will be available to offer guidance and support throughout the whole process, providing exceptional dental care that you can trust. Choosing Smile On Clinics For Your Dental Needs Alongside cosmetic dentistry and general maintenance services, you can also access top-quality care during a dental emergency. Sudden onset of unexplained pain, injury, or even urgent need for wisdom tooth removal – our dentists are here to help. Whether for a child or an adult, please call us to book an appointment as soon as possible. Even if the injury or damage may not seem severe in the first instance, there is potential for complications to develop if left untreated for too long. Whether you’re looking for an experienced dentist who offers the benefits of the latest technological developments to maintain your oral health, or whether you desire cosmetic enhancements to improve your quality of life, while restoring your amazing smile – you can rely on Smile on Clinics to give you the very best care available.

Rather than suffer quietly, our patients have benefited from the latest tech and dentistry advances to recreate their stunning smiles and boost their day-to-day confidence. And you can too! By prioritising comprehensive dental care, our multi-specialist team gives you access to all the industry-leading knowledge you require to make informed choices for all your dental needs. Using our Smile Digital Design technology, our patients undergoing reconstructive dental care treatment can now choose how their smile will look before committing to the treatment action plan. Where previously dentists would be responsible for the aesthetic choices, we give that power to our patients with the appropriate support and guidance offered wherever necessary. Additionally, our quality dental care approach means that we invest in keeping your dental treatments in-house, with the required measurements, colour-matching, and construction all taking place within the Smile On Clinics team. Our dental services are designed to ensure our patients receive efficient treatment, with frequent communication between departments so we can keep your experience as stress-free as possible. General Checkups, Professional Cleaning, And Teeth Whitening for A Healthy Smile Regular dentist visits are recommended to ensure that your oral health is in the best possible shape. During these visits, you’ll be given a comprehensive assessment to check for the usual offenders (cavities and cracks, for example). On top of this, we also include a more in-depth analysis to check for signs of emerging oral problems that may cause problems for you in the future. Early identification of these signs of potential problems allows us to create a bespoke dental care plan so you get the dental treatments you need in an efficient and effective manner. At Smile On Clinics, your trusted Charmhaven dentist will utilise our state-of-the-art technology to take photographs and X-rays that inform your care plan, while we ensure that we share all the information gathered so you can make a fully informed choice about your oral health going forward. Do You Require Dental Implants or Dentures? Our specialised team are experienced in helping adults to improve their dental health by crafting implants and dentures specifically designed to suit their dental needs. Implants are particularly suitable for cases where the tooth is chipped, cracked, or otherwise damaged to the point that it is more economical to replace than to rebuild the tooth itself. Though this may sound intimidating, we’ve created a smooth process from start to finish that lets you stay in control. Our dentists care about getting you the results you desire, that’s why we ensure we take all the measurements, down to the tiniest detail, so that we can keep your teeth looking natural, and virtually indistinguishable - no matter if we’re custom designing full mouth implants or if matching to the surrounding teeth. Straighten Crooked Teeth with The Charmhaven Dental Clinic Though crooked teeth are incredibly common, it can still have an impact on your self-confidence and quality of life. However, there are routine dental treatments available to help you boost your smile power. The most traditional route to straighter teeth is by applying braces. These are a permanent fixture, requiring regular adjustments by your dentist in Charmhaven. Braces have advanced in recent years, and are no longer the bulky, inconvenient stereotype. However, if you’re choosing braces, it’s worthwhile to research the pros and cons. While some prefer that the braces be affixed, reducing their overall maintenance, they can cause some pressure and may cause some gum irritation, too. If braces are not for you, you might find that the Smile On Straighter Aligner system is better suited to your dental needs. This approach involves wearing a clear, almost invisible, retainer for most of the day; however, you can remove the retainer to make mealtimes easier (as well as being able to clean it more closely). Both of these approaches can take time to deliver the results you desire, so rather than make you wait to see the difference, you can now use our Digital Smile application to see how you will look when your teeth have finally transformed from crooked to aligned. Preventative Treatment and Ongoing Maintenance One of the best ways to maintain your oral health is to visit your dentist near Charmhaven regularly for check-ups. Alongside brushing and flossing daily, you’ll benefit from ongoing tracking of any dental changes as well as accessing professional cleaning services to give you that refreshed and rejuvenated feeling. In some cases, where emerging damage is evident, we may take proactive action by applying a sealant to strengthen the integrity of your natural teeth and extend the life of a damaged tooth for as long as possible. By doing so, we can ensure that we do our best to offer the preventative care you need for better dental health. In other cases, it may be necessary to apply other treatments, particularly if there is more damage than a sealant can handle. In these instances, you may be offered fillings (with a choice of materials available), crowns, or bridges as necessary. Which Health Funds Can You Use? Dental treatment – particularly comprehensive dental care that provides more than a basic review – can be intimidating, particularly when it comes to financing longer treatment plans. At Smile On Clinics, we do our best when providing exceptional dental care, and we don’t want you to miss out. That’s why we accept all major health funds, including ahm, Apia, Australian Unity, Bupa, CBHS Health, HCF, and Medibank. If you use any of these providers, please let us know when you make your booking so we can assist with the process of securing funds as much as possible. Patient care is at the core of our mission. Whether we’re providing the latest in technology to assist with diagnostics, treatments, and post-treatment services, or whether we're ensuring that as many people as possible can access high-quality dental care, we are here to help. At Smile On Clinics, you’ll be given all the information you need about your dental health to ensure you can make the most informed decision possible. This information is usually gathered during your general check-up through dentist reports, with photographs and x-rays often available too.

Comprehensive Dental Care with Personalised Dental Treatments While some dental practices specialise in a few treatment options, at Smile On Clinics, you’ll receive care from our multi-specialist team. With extensive experience in using technology to enhance our patients’ experiences and outcomes, there’s no better place to go. With our Smile Digital Design technology, you have full control over your aesthetic when receiving dental implants and dentures, while also benefiting from advanced diagnostic tools. From your very first visit, we help you feel comfortable and supported during your treatment. Tests and results have a quick turnaround time, due to keeping our processes in-house as much as possible. On top of that, we also benefit from our own Smile On Lab to produce your dental implants, so we can get you the results you want as efficiently as possible. Our integrated approach to your dental care gives you the peace of mind that your treatment is in the hands of professionals. General and Preventive Dental Services Regular visits to our dental practice near Chisholm form the foundation of good oral health. Comprehensive check-ups are designed to thoroughly assess your teeth and gums for any current or potential concerns. While daily brushing and flossing is a great habit to prevent nasty residues on your teeth, we also recommend a professional cleaning to remove buildup that can occur even with hygienic dental habits. Preventative dental care aims to maintain a healthy oral environment by tackling emerging issues before they develop into larger concerns. This might include: Professional cleanings to prevent gum disease Dental sealants to protect vulnerable and damaged teeth Fluoride treatments to strengthen your enamel Early detection of potential medical issues before they require extensive dental treatments For ongoing maintenance of your dental health, we can provide personalised home care instructions for Chisholm residents and recommend products specifically suited to your dental needs. What Are Restorative Treatments for Damaged Teeth? Teeth can easily become damaged through injury, accident, or poor hygiene practices. However, cavities and cracks can be repaired through restorative treatments. At our dentist in Chisholm, you can access multiple treatment options including: Fillings for Cavities: These are perfect solutions for small areas of decay in your teeth that may be causing you issues. By applying a filling, you’ll prevent these holes from becoming larger and leading to further complications. Fillings are available in the same colour as your natural teeth, meaning the dental work isn’t as easily detected in conversation with others. Root Canal Therapy: Teeth that are infected in the centre can be particularly painful – during a root canal, the inside of the tooth is removed, with as much of the exterior structure preserved as possible. Dental Crowns and Bridges: Damaged teeth, particularly those in the front of your mouth, can lead to self-consciousness. These restorative dental treatments boost your oral health by preventing further damage from developing and potentially improving how you feel about your smile. Tooth Extractions: When necessary, we perform gentle extractions, including wisdom tooth removal, with options for sedation if necessary to ensure your comfort throughout the procedure. Advanced Dental Implant Solutions Our specialised team excels in creating custom dental implants for patients with missing teeth. These permanent replacements look and function like natural teeth, preserving jaw structure and restoring confidence. During your assessment for dental implants, your trusted Chisholm dentist will take extensive measurements and use colour matching technology to craft a perfect fit within our Smile On Labs. Each implant is custom-made, ensuring that it fits the gap comfortably and securely, is matched to your face shape and smile line, while perfect tone matching ensures that the new implant looks indistinguishable from your natural teeth. As part of your comprehensive dental care, we’ll also provide you with information on how to care for your implant so that it lasts a long time. Losing a tooth can be a difficult situation to adjust to, but Smile On Clinics will help restore your natural smile for a seamless finish. Complete Orthodontic Services for Chisholm Residents Misaligned, or crooked, teeth are very common. But if you dream of a row of straight pearly whites, then you have several options available to you. Traditional Braces: These come in several material types, and designs have been improved in recent years to increase comfort and effectiveness. These are a permanent attachment to the teeth and will require regular dentist visits for adjustment as your teeth move into their desired position. Smile On Straighter Clear Aligners: These are a non-permanent alternative to traditional braces and feature a clear aligner used for the majority of the day. However, it is possible to remove for short periods (particularly when eating or for cleaning). Early Intervention Orthodontics: For younger patients, we offer palatal expanders and space maintainers to guide proper jaw development, assessed and fitted by your Chisholm family dentist. Jaw Alignment Treatments: We address functional issues like overbites, underbites, and crossbites to improve both appearance and oral function. If you’re curious about how your appearance will change with the use of these appliances, you can now use our Digital Smile app to view potential results before any treatment has even started. This app gives you control over your final appearance, rather than allowing your dentist to do that for you. You will, however, be given guidance and support wherever necessary to ensure you get the best treatment to deliver the results you desire. Emergency Dental Care When You Need It Dental emergencies require prompt attention. Your dental practice may offer urgent appointments for: Severe toothaches Broken or cracked teeth Sudden tooth loss Gum damage Problems arising from previous dental work Quick intervention often means the difference between saving and losing a tooth during a dental emergency, so it’s best to reach out asap before additional problems develop that may require a more intense solution. Health Fund Coverage and Accessibility Exceptional dental care can be expensive, particularly for complex cases or extensive intervention. At Smile On Clinics, we do our best to ensure that as many people as possible have access to the high-quality, comprehensive dentistry in Chisholm that they need to rebuild or maintain good oral health. As such, the dental clinic accepts all major health funds, including ahm, Apia, Australian Unity, Bupa, CBHS Health, HCF, and Medibank.

    "content": "Dentists in Concord We offer our patients exceptional service using the most advanced treatment and technology available. 4.8 Google review Book now Patient Stories Practitioners Our Closest Clinic See below for the closest dental clinic we have to this area—making it simple for you to book an appointment nearby. Tailored Teeth Dental Burwood Office Hours Mon 8:00 am - 5:00 pm Tue 8:00 am - 5:00 pm Wed 8:00 am - 5:00 pm Thu 8:00 am - 5:00 pm Fri 8:00 am - 5:00 pm Sat 8:00 am - 2:00 pm Crafting Beautiful Smiles with Your Dentist in Concord At Smile On Clinics, we believe everyone deserves a smile they're proud to share. Our dental clinic near Concord combines advanced technology with personalised care to help patients overcome dental anxiety and achieve optimal oral health. Whether you're seeking routine maintenance or a complete smile transformation, our team is dedicated to providing exceptional care in a comfortable environment. Personalised Dental Care That Puts You First What sets our dental clinic near Concord apart is our commitment to patient-centred care. We understand that every smile is unique, and so are your dental needs. Our multi-specialist team takes the time to listen to your concerns, answer your questions, and develop customised dental treatment plans that align with your goals and preferences. Using innovative Smile Digital Design technology, we can show you how various treatments will transform your appearance before you commit. This visual preview helps you make confident decisions about your dental health while ensuring the results meet your expectations. Comprehensive Dental Services Under One Roof Preventative care measures are necessary to ensure a strong foundation in your dental health. Brushing and flossing are two measures you can take at home, but regular visits to your dentist for check-ups and professional cleanings are also important. During your visits to our dentist near Concord, you’ll receive thorough examinations that go beyond simply looking for cavities. Our comprehensive dental care assessments include: Professional cleaning to remove plaque and tartar Digital X-rays to detect hidden problems Oral cancer screenings Gum disease evaluation Assessment of existing restorations By identifying potential issues early, we can often provide conservative treatments for Concord residents that preserve more of the natural tooth structure, while helping to avoid costly procedures down the road. Restorative Dentistry: Rebuilding Function and Confidence with Trusted Concord Dentist When damage occurs, our restorative treatments repair teeth while maintaining natural aesthetics. Our Concord dental clinic offers multiple solutions depending on the type of restoration your tooth issue requires. If you have a cavity, we can seal the area with tooth-coloured sealant, which helps to prevent further decay while maintaining the integrity of your tooth structure. In cases of damaged or missing teeth, it can be a knock to your confidence whenever you smile (or even while speaking). Rather than go through life with this self-conscious concern, your trusted Concord dentist can help by offering bridges, crowns, veneers, or even a full mouth of implants. We’ll discuss these options with you so that you can make a fully informed decision before treatment commences. Dental pain can have an extreme effect on your day, and an infected tooth is right up there on the pain scale. If you have this, then we would recommend that you undergo a root canal treatment. Although this can be nerve-wracking, we can offer sedation if you believe the procedure will cause undue stress or discomfort. Our trusted Concord dentist will do all they can to ensure that the external structure of your tooth remains intact so that you don’t need a dental implant or other replacement. Looking For a Dentist in Concord to Replace a Missing Tooth? Tooth loss can significantly impact your confidence and oral function. Our dental implant services provide permanent, custom designed, natural-looking replacements that function exactly like natural teeth, so you can continue to speak and eat as you usually would. Replacing a missing tooth can also help preserve or restore your facial contours, and best of all, they don’t require any additional maintenance beyond the usual brushing and flossing required for the good health of your natural teeth. Our Concord dental implant specialists guide you through the entire process, from initial consultation to final restoration, ensuring predictable results and a comfortable experience. You can also view possible smile matches on our Digital Smile app, allowing you to see the potential results before any work has even started. Advanced Orthodontic Options for All Ages at Your Family Dentist near Concord Misaligned teeth affect more than just appearance—they can impact speech, chewing ability, and long-term dental health. Our Concord dental practice offers multiple orthodontic solutions, including traditional (permanent) braces, and clear aligners/Invisalign (removable for brief periods). These dental services are available to Concord residents of all ages. However, we would first need to do an extensive assessment before making a recommendation for this course of treatment. Particularly young children (below teens) may be advised to avoid treatment unless absolutely necessary, as they are still growing. Teens and adults may benefit more often from the comprehensive dental care our orthodontist offers, particularly in cases where teeth alignment is proving to be a concern. However, there may be cases where early intervention is the best course to reduce the potential for more expensive interventions later. If you’re uncertain, please speak with your dentist in Concord to find out more information about your unique circumstances and the action that they would recommend. Cosmetic Dentistry for Concord Residents Cosmetic dentistry refers to those procedures and treatments that are not essential for good oral health, but would enhance your confidence or give your self-image a boost. Aesthetic treatments show that you take good care of yourself and want to make your appearance more closely match your idea of aesthetically pleasing. Treatments covered in this include professional whitening services, porcelain veneers applied over your natural teeth, or dental bonding to fix small chips or cracks that you don’t like and no longer wish to see. The Concord dental practice team combines technical skill with an artistic eye to create results that enhance your natural features while looking authentically yours. Comfortable Care for Dental Anxiety at Your Dentist Near Concord Many patients delay necessary treatment due to dental anxiety. At our dental clinic near Concord, we've created an environment specifically designed to ease these concerns: Gentle techniques that prioritise your comfort Clear communication about what to expect Sedation options for those with severe anxiety Patient-controlled pacing during treatment We believe that understanding what's happening during your appointment reduces anxiety, so we take the time to explain procedures and answer questions thoroughly. Smile On Clinics: Your Partner in Lifelong Oral Health At Smile On Clinics, our relationship with patients extends far beyond treating immediate concerns. We strive to be your partners in maintaining lifelong dental health through: Personalised preventative care plans Education about home care techniques Regular monitoring of dental conditions Coordination with specialists when needed Visit our dental clinic near Concord today to experience the difference that truly patient-centred care can make in your dental experience and overall oral health.

Smile On Clinics is a local leader in both general dentistry and cosmetic treatments. From checkups to crowns, and cleanings to clear aligners, our experts have the skills and cutting-edge technology to make your next trip to a dentist in Griffith smooth and comfortable. Find a Qualified Orthodontist in Griffith Our dental clinics offer all common dental treatments designed to keep your smile white and healthy. Explore our range of treatment options below: General dental check-ups and cleanings Are you seeking a standard dental checkup? That’s no problem, and we’ll use the most advanced technology to assess your dental hygiene comprehensively and provide exceptional dental care. We also offer cleanings, which are designed to remove bacteria, plaque and tartar buildup from the surfaces of your teeth. It is recommended that you complete a teeth cleaning every six months for the best smile. Our general dentistry services also cover other services, such as crowns, veneers and implants. If you’re looking for a Griffith family dentist, Smile On Clinic’s range of generalist treatments ensures we can keep your family’s smiles in tip-top condition. Fillings for cavities Did you know that over 3/4 of the Australian population has had at least one filling? Our dentists can help install the filling type of your choice, aiming for a pain-free procedure. Teeth whitening If you’re looking to brighten your smile, we offer safe, effective teeth whitening. Using the most cutting-edge whitening methods, we restore unsightly stains to bright, clean tooth surfaces. Root canal therapy Root canal therapy is a highly effective dental treatment designed to save damaged or infected teeth, relieve pain and restore your natural smile. By gently removing the infection inside the tooth and sealing it, a root canal therapy procedure helps you avoid extractions, returning you to eating, speaking and smiling confidently. Tooth extractions Tooth extractions are a safe and routine procedure to remove damaged, decayed or problematic teeth, preserving your dental health in the long term. For example, a tooth extraction may be required if there’s a troublesome wisdom tooth removal. A tooth extraction will help relieve discomfort and pave the way for long-term solutions like dental implants or restorative treatments. Our tooth extractions are conducted using the best practices and technologies. Dental crowns and bridges Dental crowns are custom-made restorations designed to strengthen damaged or weakened teeth. As well as protecting damaged teeth, dental crowns will restore their natural look and function. Whether you need to repair a cracked tooth or complete a root canal treatment, crowns offer long-lasting protection and an effortlessly confident smile. Dental bridges fulfil a similar function. By filling gaps to restore your bite and enhance your appearance, dental bridges effectively substitute one or more missing teeth. Overall, bridges help you chew, speak and smile comfortably – without compromising your teeth’s natural appearance. Braces (metal, ceramic, lingual) Braces don’t have to be a source of embarrassment – find the braces that work for you with our range of options. When you chat to our dentists about orthodontic treatments they’ll help you find the right braces to serve you – and your smile. Smile On Straighter (clear aligners) Smile On Straighter Clear Aligners are a game-changing corrective treatment designed to move your teeth’s position comfortably. By gradually moving your teeth using a series of clear aligners, you can experience your straightest possible smile. The clear appearance reduces the aligners’ visibility for the most natural possible appearance. Retainers (post-treatment maintenance) After corrective orthodontics, consider maintaining your natural smile through custom-made retainers. These retainers will fit snugly around your teeth, preventing natural reversion towards their original position. Palatal expanders Palatal expanders are a staple of orthodontics. Designed to widen the upper arch, they’ll gently address overcrowding and crossbite. Jaw alignment treatments They’re just as they sound – jaw alignment treatments will use various implements (e.g. braces) to correct the jaw gently. Benefits of a corrected jaw include improved chewing, swallowing and breathing and improved function of the teeth. Early intervention orthodontics Whatever your requirements, Smile On Clinics has got you covered – and that includes dental needs like early intervention orthodontics (sometimes referred to as interceptive orthodontics). Early intervention orthodontics is an orthopaedic approach that ensures that the teeth and jaws develop correctly in children. Comprehensive oral exams Looking to understand your oral health in full? Smile On Clinics’ comprehensive dental care will ensure that you can make informed decisions about your dental health. Preventative dental care (cleanings, sealants) Effective preventative care will prevent the need for dental surgery – implants, extractions and so forth. Sealants will coat the surface of a vulnerable tooth, preventing further decay. Restorative services (fillings, crowns, bridges) Restorative services are essential in dentistry, and you should expect your local dental practice to provide all the basics – fillings, crowns and bridges. Cosmetic dentistry (veneers, whitening, bonding) Our Griffith dental clinic also offers a range of cosmetic dentistry treatments. For example, if you’re looking for high-quality veneers, we’re happy to assist. Orthodontic treatments (braces, aligners) Hundreds of thousands of Australians get braces, and once the braces have successfully realigned the teeth, we’ll fashion aligners to keep them in place. Emergency dental care (toothache, trauma repair) A dental emergency can be a source of intense anxiety. However, our expert approach will provide peace of mind when dealing with an out-of-hours emergency. It’s part of our commitment to serving local families – emergencies don’t always come at convenient times, and we’ve adjusted our availability to match.

Office Hours Mon 8:00 am - 5:00 pm Tue 8:00 am - 5:00 pm Wed 8:00 am - 5:00 pm Thu 8:00 am - 5:00 pm Fri 8:00 am - 5:00 pm Sat 8:00 am - 2:00 pm Find a Local Dentist Looking for dental clinic that you can really trust? Smile On Clinics has established a stellar local reputation for exceptional dental care. Whether you're experiencing a dental emergency or looking for comprehensive dental care, we've got you covered. What Treatments Does Our Dental Practice Offer? Ideally, a family dentist should provide a range of dental treatments to cater for all oral health requirements. Let's break down a sample of the dental services that Smile On Clinics offers. General dental check-ups and cleanings If you're looking for a dentist near Huskisson who can fulfil the 'bread and butter' functions of comprehensive dental care - i.e. check-ups and simple cleans - then Smile On Clinics could be a good fit. We're focused on providing exceptional dental care at every level - regardless of whether you're looking for specialist cosmetic dentistry or just a simple scaling treatment, Smile On Clinics can exceed your expectations for all of your dental needs. Fillings for cavities High-quality dental care also includes reactive treatments like fillings for cavities. Fillings restore the teeth's appearance and functionality while protecting them from further decay. Teeth whitening Smile On Clinics can assist with cosmetic treatments like teeth whitening - if you're seeking a dental clinic catering to more than just general check-ups. Using enamel-safe teeth whitening techniques, we'll unlock your teeth's potential and show them off to their best effect. Root canal therapy In rare cases, a dentist might assess your oral health and decide that root canal therapy might be the best course of action. Root canal therapy cleans infected pulp from within a tooth and reseals it to prevent further infection. Tooth extractions If a tooth is damaged or in the wrong position, an extraction may be necessary. Smile On Clinics aims for a painless procedure, ensuring the best possible outcome. A dental extraction can then be followed by a dental implant, which replaces a missing tooth with a synthetic (yet natural-looking) substitute that is firmly stationed through titanium screws. Dental crowns and bridges Dental crowns and bridges are common procedures designed to alleviate teeth's natural wear and tear. A dental crown is a cap that's placed over the tooth and protects it from erosion. A dental bridge is a solid structure that replaces a missing tooth. Braces (metal, ceramic, lingual) Hundreds of thousands of Australians have worn braces. Whether it's metal or ceramic braces or a lingual brace (also known as a 'hidden brace', as it nestles on the inside of the teeth), Smile On Clinics can provide you with the braces you need to quickly align your teeth into the desired position. Smile On Straighter (clear aligners) Likewise, Smile On Straighter Clear Aligners are a tried-and-tested approach for naturally shifting your teeth into a straighter and more even appearance. Clear aligners move your teeth gradually, and its clear appearance is inconspicuous. Retainers (post-treatment maintenance) What are you going to do after treatment to maintain your teeth's optimal position? Well, retainers, as their name suggests, keep your teeth in place, fitting snugly around your teeth. Palatal expanders Another orthodontic staple, palatal expanders open the upper arch, preventing overcrowding. If you think you might need palatal expanders, consult with your dentist. Jaw alignment treatments Jaw alignment treatments encapsulate a number of orthodontic treatments designed to improve the position of your jaw. A better-aligned jaw will help with activities like swallowing, eating and breathing, as well as relieving discomfort. Early intervention orthodontics Quality dental care doesn't start at any particular age - and early intervention orthodontics is the proof. They're designed to ensure that your child's mouth and jaw develop healthily, hopefully leading to good orthodontic and dental health in adolescence and adulthood. Comprehensive oral exams A comprehensive oral exam will imbue you with a complete understanding of your oral health and the steps you can take to improve it. Preventative dental care (cleanings, sealants) They say prevention is better than a cure, and this principle certainly applies to dentistry. The best dentists will be focused on being proactive rather than reactive. Accordingly, they should offer teeth cleaning services and sealants (sealants are coatings for your back teeth, which slow down erosion). Restorative services (fillings, crowns, bridges) Smile On Clinics’ restorative dental services - including fillings, crowns, and bridges - are designed to repair and strengthen damaged teeth. These restorative services will improve the appearance and function of weakened teeth. Whether you need a simple filling to treat a cavity, a crown to protect a weakened tooth, or a bridge to replace missing teeth, we can explore tailored solutions with you. Our goal? To help you regain a healthy, confident smile. Our advanced, industry-leading materials and techniques ensure durable, natural-looking results that let you eat, speak and - most importantly - smile with ease. Cosmetic dentistry (veneers, whitening, bonding) Our dental practice also offers cosmetic dentistry so you can achieve your dream smile. Whether you're seeking porcelain veneers or you're looking for a specialist whitening treatment, we've got you covered. Orthodontic treatments (braces, aligners) Braces and aligners are both classic examples of orthodontic treatments that can fix your teeth's alignment (as well as straighten their appearance). If you think your teeth's positioning could benefit from braces or aligners, please reach out to your local dentist clinic. Emergency dental care (toothache, trauma repair) Rarely, individuals may experience a dental emergency, such as wisdom tooth removal, that necessitates emergency dental care. Tooth-related emergencies can cause extreme discomfort, and it is essential to find a local dentist who can provide out-of-hours services. Get in Touch with a Trusted Dentist We cater to all Huskisson residents, so whatever dental services you're looking for, we'll meet all your dental needs.
